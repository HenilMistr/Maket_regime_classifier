# 🧠 Market Regime Classifier & Strategy Backtester

This project is a multi-stage financial analysis pipeline designed to classify market regimes and develop data-driven trading strategies. It includes technical indicator generation, machine learning classification, regime-aware strategy evaluation, and hyperparameter optimization using Optuna.

---

## 📈 Project Goals
Classify Market Regimes (Bull, Bear, Sideways) using technical indicators and trend logic.

Predict Price Movement with machine learning classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost).

Backtest and Evaluate Strategies based on classification signals.

Optimize Strategy Parameters per regime using Optuna.

## 🧩 Project Structure
Level 1 – Trend-Based Regime Classification
Uses moving averages and volatility bands to label market regimes.

Visualizes classified regimes on price charts.

Level 2 – Strategy Evaluation
Backtests simple and indicator-based (RSI, MACD) strategies.

Calculates financial metrics: Sharpe Ratio, CAGR, Max Drawdown.

Compares performance across strategies and regimes.

Level 3 – Machine Learning Classification
Prepares technical features (Returns, MA, RSI, MACD, Momentum, Volatility).

Trains and evaluates:

RandomForestClassifier

XGBoostClassifier

Uses classification_report, confusion matrix, and accuracy metrics.

Predicts next-day price movement as Up, Down, or Flat.

Regime-Based Strategy Optimization (Bonus)
Uses Optuna to find optimal strategy parameters (e.g., threshold, indicators).

Optimizes based on Sharpe Ratio, CAGR, or other metrics.

Returns a best-fit strategy per regime type.

## 🧠 Machine Learning

### Models Used
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

### Features
- Lagged returns
- Momentum
- Volatility
- RSI

- Regime label

---

## 📈 Strategy Logic

Different regimes trigger different strategy signals:
- **Bull Market**: Buy when RSI > 50 or MACD histogram is positive
- **Bear Market**: Sell when RSI < 50 or MACD histogram is negative
- **Sideways Market**: No position

Backtest performance is compared to a baseline strategy.
